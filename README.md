## Project setup
If the codebase appears broken, try installing the packages using `npm ci` instead of `npm i`.

Almost all of the issues developers encounter when using this codebase stem from (sub)package versions that differ from the ones used in this project.
`npm ci` will ensure that only the exact package versions that are listed in the `package-lock.json` file are installed.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
```
npm run start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
